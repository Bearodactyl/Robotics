But, it is not as easy for drones, as we have to account for the drone's attitude, and we might have to accelerate and decelerate at the start and end points. Come to think of it, maybe we are already flying at a certain velocity at point A, and want to have a certain velocity at point B! Clearly, this is not as easy as it appears.\n",

    "## Optimizing for Position\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out we can optimize for position only, without worrying about attitude, at least at first. This is not a trivial statement, and it is also very fortunate. Let us assume that we want to fly in a forest, full of trees, and we want a trajectory for the drone avoid the trees. A quadrotor-style drone trajectory has the potential to be rather complicated: the drone lives in the 6DOF space of position (3DOF) and attitude (3DOF). And we know from Section 7.2 that attitude will *affect* position: if we pitch or role, that will affect our velocity, and that will integrate into position. That very mechanism is also a source of complexity: a drone is *under-actuated*: we cannot directly control the 6DOF, we have to do it through the action only four rotors. It seems like a very complex problem indeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "When given a continuous trajectory of position that also behaves well in terms of velocity, we can obtain the pitch, roll, and thrust trajectories to obtain it. Of course, it can't be a totally crazy trajectory: a drone can't stop on a dime, or teleport, or go faster than certain limits. But if we have a 3DOF translational trajectory that is well behaved, we can \"upgrade\" it to a full position/attitude in two different ways: in advance, by solving a large optimization problem, or physically, in real-time, by using a tracking controller. The latter is what we will do, after obtaining a trajectory."

    "## Occupancy and Cost Maps\n",
    "\n",
    "A very popular approach to represent environments with different obstacles is to use an **occupancy map**. An occupancy map is essentially a 2D array of cells, each representing the environment at a certain resolution (for example, 10 cm by 10 cm). Each cell in this map contains a probability for the presence of an obstacle. This concept is further extendable to distinguish between various types of obstacles, each with different levels of lethality. This extended version can then be transformed into a **cost map**, where areas with less hazardous obstacles (like tall grass) are considered less costly compared to more dangerous ones (like flying into a tree). For our purposes, we will start directly with cost maps instead of creating true occupancy maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, let us consider creating a simple example cost map. In the `gtbook` library, we have a function named `create_random_map`. This function requires as parameters the width $W$, height $H$, and the number of obstacles to create a random arrangement of obstacles within the map. Width and height are given in meters, and the resolution is hardcoded at 10 cm. An optional parameter is a random seed, which allows for the reproduction of the exact experiment setup. The following code snippet demonstrates how to generate a random map with 50 obstacles using a random seed of 42:"
