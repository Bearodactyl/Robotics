NeRFs are a novel, data-driven solution to the long-standing problem in computer graphics of the realistic rendering of virtual worlds.

For every sample, the neural network $F_\\Theta$ is queried for both a local *density* $\\delta$ and a *color* $c$. The colors are then integrated along the ray, their contributions mediated by the local density, to yield a final pixel color.\n",

    "- the actual images themselves\n",
    "- accurate geometry from where the images were taken\n",
    "\n",
    "The latter is important because, as we saw above, a NeRF is trained with a set of *rays*. For a given image, every pixel in the image corresponds to a ray. The *origin* of the ray is exactly the optical center of the camera used to acquire the image, so we need at least that information. But to calculate, for every pixel, the *direction* of the ray needs a lot more. In fact, this is typically a two step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the *intrinsic* calibration of the camera, most importantly the focal length, tells us how to convert pixel coordinates into a direction in the camera frame.\n",
    "- the *extrinsic* calibration, position and orientation with which the image was taken, is needed to transform directions in the camera frame into the scene coordinate frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Acquiring all this information for an arbitrary image sequence taken with some unknown, uncalibrated camera can be complicated. Cameras come in a variety of sizes and with very different lenses, and effects like radial distortion make the modeling process non-trivial. In addition, recovering the actual position and attitude of the camera in a scene is typically done through structure from motion, which can be time-consuming and tricky."
