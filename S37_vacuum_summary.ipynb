    "## Models\n",
    "\n",
    "The key modeling tool that we introduced is the language of Bayesian networks. Bayes nets are a type of graphical model named after reverend Bayes, who also gave his name to the practice of interpreting probability distributions as *beliefs* rather than observed frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "A foundational Bayes net family is the Markov chain, modeling a state evolving over time. State transitions are modeled using a conditional distribution of the current state, conditioned on the previous state, invoking the Markov property. A Markov chain is then a sequence of such transition conditionals, and this in itself is an incredibly powerful idea. Typically, these transitions are *stationary*, in that they do not depend on time, but we have introduced *controlled* Markov chains to capture the dependence of the state on actions. This is an essential tool in robotics: modeling how the state of the robot and/or its environment changes -probabilistically- as a result of the robot's actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unrolling a Bayes net fragment over time was then generalized to the concept of Dynamic Bayes Nets (DBNs), allowing us to also model noisy sensors measuring aspects of the state. The DBN framework allowed us to precisely capture the fact that these measurements only depend on the current state, and that the states themselves are Markov, conditioned on a given action. These two modeling assumptions, coupled with reasoning in a discrete time-setting, are so universal in robotics that the particular action-state-measurement Dynamic Bayes Net from Section 3.3 describes almost all robot modeling approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key properties of Dynamic Bayes nets is that they are easy to sample from , using ancestral sampling, which allows us to simulate what a given sequence of actions might accomplish, and what we would measure in these hypothetical roll-outs. This is used to illustrate or even power various perception and planning algorithms, which we discuss below."

    "Markov chains date back to -you guessed it- [Andrey Markov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Markov) who used them to study, among other things, the statistics of language. In fact, attesting to the importance and generality of the concept, any finite-context large language model can be viewed as a Markov chain - admittedly with a rather vast state space."
